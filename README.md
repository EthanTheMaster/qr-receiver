# What is this?
This is the receiver program for the [`qr-transmitter` program](https://github.com/EthanTheMaster/qr-transmitter). This project is written in `Javascript` and `Rust` as a test for WASM/WebAssembly. The pure JS version can be found in `pkg/qr_receiver_purejs.html` and the WASM version in `pkg/qr_receiver_wasm.html`. The receiver was written as a web app due to the cross-platform capabilites of the web. [Thanks to cozmo for his JS QR decoder implementation!](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR). [Here is a demo of the program in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvwe5HSOPU0).

# How to compile WASM project
You will need to [install `wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) to compile this program. Once it has been installed, enter the project directory and run `wasm-pack build --target no-modules`. Make sure to either extract out the `.js` and `.wasm` files into the directory of the WASM version of the receiver or simply keep the receiver`.html` file in the `pkg/` directory.
